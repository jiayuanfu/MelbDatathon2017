This GeoPack provides geometry for states, local government areas (LGAs) and postcodes within Australia. It includes census derived demographics for population by age, as well as various demographics for area income, labor force and unemployment.
Please note that because LGA to postcode is not a standard hierarchy some LGAs do not have demographic associated with them. Also note that postcodes do not cover 100% of land areas.

To use this GeoPack, complete the following:

	1. Navigate to Administration > Admin Console in your Yellowfin system. 
	2. Open the GeoPack Management section at the bottom of the Admin Console
	3. Click the 'Add or Update GeoPack' link
	4. Drag the AusPostcodePack.gbk file onto the upload area. 
		Wait for Yellowfin to upload and process the file. This may take some time.
	5. You can now link your pack to data in your Views.
