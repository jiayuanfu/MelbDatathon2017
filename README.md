# **Melbourne Datathon 2017**

Submission for Melbourne Datathon 2017, a Kaggle competition that consists of two parts: predicting diabetes development and delivering a data analytics/business analytics presentation.

## **Data**

The data used in this competition is not included in this repository. It is recommended to download the data from Kaggle for those who wish to run this code.

## Part 1: **Predicting Diabetes Development**

The code is used to generate prediction for the Kaggle Melbourne Datathon 2017 competition with a selection of machine learning models. 

For the data pipeline, the raw data has been uploaded and transformed to features by mySQL.  The machine learning models were built using **`scikit-learn`** to predict if a person would develop diabetes in the coming year based on a provided dataset. 

### Tech Stack:

- scikit-learn
- mySQL

## Part 2: Insight Competition

A data analytics/business analytics presentation was delivered, detailing an investment strategy for Chemist House. The graphs in the presentation was created using Tableau and can be found in the file **`Harvest your investment on Chemist House.pdf`**.

### Tech Stack:

- mySQL
- Tableau
- Presentation
